        <h1>Images</h1>

        <p>This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for <a href="links.html">links</a>.</p>

        <h2>JPGs</h2>
        
        <!--JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size. This makes them great for photos and images with lots of gradients in them. On the other hand, JPGs don’t allow for transparent pixels-->

        <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>

        <h2>GIFs</h2>

        <!--GIFs are the go-to option for simple animations, but the trade off is that they’re somewhat limited in terms of color palette—never use them for photos. Transparent pixels are a binary option for GIFs, meaning you can’t have semi-opaque pixels. This can make it difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent background. For this reason, it’s usually better to use PNG images if you don’t need animation.-->

        <p>GIFs are good for animations.</p>

        <h2>PNGs</h2>

        <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.</p>

        <img src="images/mochi.png" width="75" alt="A mochi ball"/>

        <h2>SVGs</h2>

        <!--Unlike the pixel-based image formats above, SVG is a vector-based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality. This property makes SVG images a wonderful tool for responsive design. They’re good for pretty much all the same use cases as PNGs, and you should use them whenever you can.-->

        <p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use the wherever you can.</p>
