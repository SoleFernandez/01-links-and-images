        <h1>Links</h1>

        <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>
        <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

        <ul>
            <!--“Absolute” links are the most detailed way you can refer to a web resource. They start with the “scheme” (typically http:// or https://), followed by the domain name of the website, then the path of the target web page.-->
            <li>Absolute links, like to
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.</li>

            <!--“Relative” links point to another file in your website from the vantage point of the file you’re editing. It’s implied that the scheme and domain name are the same as the current page, so the only thing you need to supply is the path.-->
            <li>Relative links, like to our <a href="misc/extras.html">extras page</a>.</li>

            <!--This won't work for our local HTML files. But if we have a real server, the link to our home page would look like this:-->
            <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href="/">home page</a> of our website, but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>

            <!--The only difference between a root-relative link and a relative one is that the former starts with a forward slash. That initial forward slash represents the root of your site. You can add more folders and files to the path after that initial slash, just like relative links.-->
        </ul>
